Bubo Reviewer is your virtual development companion, a "mock" reviewer that streamlines your workflow as you explore and become familiar with development processes. Designed for those moments when you venture into development without reviewers but still want to follow a workflow based on protected branches and pull requests.

## üåü Key Features

- **Automated Reviews**: Bubo Reviewer automates the review process for your pull requests.

- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your existing development workflow, making it easy to maintain a consistent process even when real reviewers are not available.

- **Customizable Rules**: Define custom rules and coding standards that Bubo Reviewer will use to evaluate your pull requests.

- **Merge Automation**: Bubo can also automatically merge your pull requests when they meet your defined criteria.

## üíª Tech

Bubo Reviewer is powered by a set of modern technologies:

- **JavaScript**: The core logic of Bubo Reviewer is built on JavaScript.

- **Node.js**: Bubo Reviewer runs in the Node.js environment. Node.js is fundamental for listening and responding to real-time GitHub webhook events.

- **GitHub App**: Bubo Reviewer is a custom GitHub App, which means it integrates directly with your repository and processes pull request and code change-related events.

- **Octokit**: To interact programmatically with the GitHub API, Bubo Reviewer uses the Octokit library. Octokit simplifies communication with GitHub.
  [@octokit/rest](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/): For working with GitHub's REST API.
  [@octokit/webhooks](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks.js): For handling GitHub webhooks.
